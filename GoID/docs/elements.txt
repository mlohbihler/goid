### Agent body

- A bite of a food source has a specific mass
- Only a given amount of food mass can be in the digestive system at a time. Over-eating damages the health of the agent.
- Food mass is digested at a certain rate
- Elements that are digested are are reported to the brain to allow association with food sources
- Agent damage is measured from 0 to 50M, at which point death occurs
- Damage incurred is reported to the brain (pain?)


## Elements
- change death probabilities to health damage
- change amounts from int to long

# Watus
- ideal range 500M - 1.5B
- pro rate death probability between 50M and 500M
- pro rate death probability between 1.5B and 1.8B
- rest rate: 400/t
- move rate: +400/t

# Carbus
- ideal range 3M - 100M
- pro rate speed reduction between 1M and 10M
- pro rate death probability between 1M and 3M
- pro rate death probability between 100M and 300M
- rest rate: 10/t
- move rate: +150/t

# Protus
- ideal range 1M - 100M
- pro rate death probability between 300K and 1M
- pro rate death probability between 100M and 250M
- metabolic rate: 20/t
- healing rate: +30/t

# Lipus
- ideal range 1M - 500M
- pro rate death probability between 100K and 1M
- pro rate death probability between 500M and 1B
- when carbus drops below 3M lipus can replace at an exchange of 4C for 1L
- used at a rate of 4/t

# Hemlus
- ideal amount: 0
- pro rate death probability between 10K and 25K
- used at a rate of 1/t

# Vitamus
- ideal range 100K - 50M
- pro rate death probability between 10K and 100K
- pro rate death probability between 50M and 500M
- used at a minimum rate of 2/t, proportionate to the current amount

# Minerus
- ideal range 30K - 50M
- pro rate death probability between 5K and 30K
- pro rate death probability between 50M and 500M
- used at a minimum rate of 1/t, proportionate to the current amount

# Fibrus
- not digested
- used at a rate of 1000/t
