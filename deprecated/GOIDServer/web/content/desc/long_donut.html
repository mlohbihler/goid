  You are <b>strongly encouraged</b> to visit the <a href="/help">help</a> page before trying this out. There you will
  find a brief introduction to the game, and everything will make oh so much more sense.
</p>
<p>
  You are also <b>strongly encouraged</b> to <a href="/register">register</a> because your scripts and other settings
  will be automatically saved and reloaded when you return (because we all know you'll be back, right? Right?). Also,
  'run mode' is only enabled for registered users, and you'll need this to have your score ranked in the system.

  The area shaded in light yellow is where the agent needs to move next. Once the agent reaches it, the next area will
  become shaded instead, and so on. 
</p>
<p>
  The sample script (press <img src="/images/script_lightning.png"/>) for this task simply has the agent move in a wide 
  arc, counter-clockwise when there are no obstacles, and clockwise when there are obstacles. This script (like most 
  sample scripts) will get the job done, but is not optimised. (What would be the fun then?)
</p>
<p>
  Hint: try increasing the clockwise turn rate. Of course, there are lots of other things you can try.
