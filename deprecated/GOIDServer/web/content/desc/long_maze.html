  The agent in this task is a small "robot" that starts off somewhere near the middle of a maze, facing a random 
  direction. The agent's primary senses are two sensors (blue circles) on its left and right called "eyes" which
  are triggered when they intersect the wall, and a "probe" (also blue) which senses the distance of the wall
  directly in front of the robot. Secondarily, the agent is given constant indicator of the distance to its current
  goal (the yellow patch of ground).

  There are four goal areas located in the corners of the maze, but only one will be active to start. When that one is
  touched, one of the other three will activate. The order of the corner-goals is random, so you'll need to rely heavily
  on the goalDistance sense when navigating. Once all four corner goals have been reached, the final goal will activate at
  the agent's starting location.

  Though the maze is psuedo-random, there are a few important constants. The maze is contiguous, which means there are no
  islands, and it is possible to reach any point in the maze by following one of the walls. The maze is square, and more 
  specifically, it's 21 wall-widths wide. The paths are the same widths as the walls. All angles are right angles. The 
  entire square is always used. Using these facts, it should be possible to build an acurate representation of the space
  in a short period of time.

  Unlike in other tasks, the maze robot is unable to sense any absolute values for position or direction, so must build
  a picture of its surroundings as it wanders. The probe is probably the most useful sense for this, but don't rely on it
  too heavily for navigation. Because the agent is round and the probe acts in a line, it's easy to run into corners
  without the probe sensing them. Integrate the agent's senses and build an acurate model of the maze to get the best time!
