The environment is the "universe" of the task. Often it is a two-dimensional space in which the agent (or multiple 
agents) can roam. It also controls non-agent processes as appropriate to the task such as the growth of plants, the
control or foreign-species agents, diurnal events, etc. It might more abstract, such as a a stock market in which 
agents are traders.
