An agent is an actor in an environment, with behaviour that is controlled by a script. For example, in the Donut task
the agent is a bug that needs to complete a lap around an island. Depending on the task, agents could also be robotic 
arms, a stock trading system, or a member in a species of agents. An agent embodies the script that controls it as well
as its current state&mdash;such as orientation, location, etc. (Note that in some tasks a single script will control 
multiple agents, each with its own state.)
